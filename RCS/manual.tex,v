\section*{Introduction}

This document, by Silvio Levy, describes the C++ program \ev/ for
turning the sphere inside out without tears, creases, or pinches.  The
program was written by Nathaniel Thurston, and is based on ideas of
Bill Thurston.

We assume you are familiar with the basic ideas of the algorithm for
turning the sphere inside out described in the computer-animated video
\OI/.  This video, created at the Geometry Center (University of
Minnesota) and directed by Silvio Levy, Tamara Munzner and Delle
Maxwell, gives an elementary description of the eversion, and shows it
step by step, from different points of view.  You should also consult
the full-color illustrated book {\it Making Waves: A Guide to the
Ideas Behind \OI/}, which comes with the video.  \OI/ and \MW/ are

\section*{Preparation}

\Ev/ is written in C++, GNU dialect (gcc).  Binary executables are
provided for the Sparc, the SGI, and the Next; however, the program
should compile and run on any system having gcc.  If you have a
different machine and want to compile the program for it, type
``make'' and see what happens.  There may be some harmless warning
messages at all events. If there is more serious trouble, send mail to
levy@@geom.umn.edu: I will try to help you, but no guarantees.

\Ev/ takes no input, other than command-line options.  Its output is a
file of numbers representing the sphere (or, more usually, a piece of it) at
a given point in the eversion.

This means that, in order to see the output, you need to be able to
transform the numbers---that is, the geometry of the sphere---into a
picture.  There are various programs that do this.  One is called
Geomview, and is freely available from the Geometry Center, by
anonymous ftp from the server geom.umn.edu, in directory pub/software.
It runs on many computers under X-windows, as well as on SGI and Next
workstations.  Geomview reads in a geometry file like the one output
by \ev/, and produces an image in a window, where it can be
interactively manipulated: rotated, translated, colored, etc.
Geomview can also rewrite the data so that it becomes acceptable to
Renderman, a program that creates a static image of much higher
quality than that produced by an interactive viewer.  The images that
appear in \OI/ were created using Renderman.  Renderman was created by
Pixar and is sold by them.

If you don't have Geomview but have a different viewing program, you
may be able to adapt the output of {\tt evert} to serve as input to
your program, either by changing the code or by writing an output
filter.  If you do that, we would appreciate hearing from you and
getting a copy of your code.

\section*{Running {\tt evert}}

This is how you run \ev/ from the command line:

\smallbreak
{\tt evert} [{\it options\/}] [{\tt >} {\it outfile}]
\smallbreak\noindent
Here {\tt >} is the Unix character for sending output for a file;
if you are running the program on another system, change accordingly.

The options are the following:

\begin{description} 
%\item[{\tt-scene}/{\tt-bscene}] (boolean)
%\item[{\tt-bendtime}] (float)
\item[{\tt-time} $t$ (float)]
Creates the geometry of the sphere at time $t$.  Time varies from 0 to
1, during which period it parametrizes the whole eversion process.
From $t=t_0=0$ to $t=t_1=0.1$, the sphere becomes corrugated.  From
$t_1$ to $t_2=0.23$, the poles are pushed through each other.  From
$t_2$ to $t_3=0.6$, the sphere gets twisted: the poles rotate in
opposite directions, and the loop around the equator disappears.  From
$t_3$ to $t_4=0.93$, the strips and corrugations are pushed through
the center, with the poles held fixed.  Finally, from $t_4$ to $t=1$,
the sphere loses its corrugations.  The values of $t_0$, $t_1$, $t_2$,
$t_3$, and $t_4$ are not hardwired: they can be controlled by the next
five options.  They should obey the inequalities $0\le
t_0<t_1<t_2<t_3<t_4<1$, or unpredictable results will be obtained.

\item[{\tt-corr} $t_0$ (float)]
Set the milestone $t_0$ for the beginning of the corrugation phase;
default 0 (see {\tt-time}).  No output is generated if $t<t_0$.

\item[{\tt-push} $t_1$ (float)]
Set the milestone $t_1$ for the beginning of the pushing phase;
default 0.1 (see {\tt-time}).  

\item[{\tt-twist} $t_2$ (float)]
Set the milestone $t_2$ for the beginning of the twisting phase;
default 0.23 (see {\tt-time}).  

\item[{\tt-unpush} $t_3$ (float)]
Set the milestone $t_3$ for the beginning of the unpushing phase;
default 0.6 (see {\tt-time}).  

\item[{\tt-uncorr} $t_4$ (float)]
Set the milestone $t_4$ for the beginning of the uncorrugation phase;
default 0.93 (see {\tt-time}).  

\item[{\tt-nstrips} $n$ (float)]
The sphere is made of $n$ guide strips alternating with $n$
corrugations.  The default for $n$ is eight.  If you set $n$ too
low you will get pinch points, so the eversion will not be a regular
homotopy.

\item[{\tt-umin} $u_{\min}$ (float)]
The sphere is parametrized by the variable $u$ in the north-south
direction, that is, a fixed value of $u$ gives a parallel of latitude.
The parameter $u$ ranges between $u_{\min}$ and $u_{\max}$.  The default
for $u_{\min}$ is 0, corresponding to a pole.

\item[{\tt-umax} $u_{\max}$ (float)]
Maximum value of the parameter $u$ (see previous entry); default is
$1$, indicating the equator.  Setting $u_{\max}=2$ (and keeping
$u_{\min}=0$) gives a strip from pole to pole; but there is a better way
to do this, as explained in the Symmetries section below.

\item[{\tt-du} $\,\Delta u$ (float)]
Increment in the value of $u$.  The default value is $u={1\over12}$,
so the fundamental unit of the sphere is subdivided into twelve, from
pole to equator.

\item[{\tt-vmin} $t_{\min}$ (float)]
The sphere is parametrized by the variable $v$ in the east-west
direction, that is, a fixed value of $v$ gives a meridian.  The
parameter $v$ ranges between $v_{\min}$ and $v_{\max}$; when
$v_{\max}=v_{\min}+1$ the result is a ``fundamental unit'' of the sphere,
from which the rest can be deduced by rotation, as explained in the
Symmetries section below.

\item[{\tt-vmax} (float)]
Maximum value of the parameter $v$ (see previous entry); default is
$1$, which together with $v_{\min}=0$ gives a fundamental unit of the
sphere.  Setting $v_{\max}$ to the number of strips (see {\tt-nstrips})
and keeping $v_{\min}=0$ gives all the strips, and so a whole
hemisphere; but there is a better way to do this, as explained in the
Symmetries section below.

\item[{\tt-dv} $\,\Delta v$ (float)]
Increment in the value of $v$.  The default value is $v={1\over12}$,
so the fundamental unit of the sphere is subdivided into twelve, from
the western edge to the eastern.

\item[{\tt-scale} $s$ (float)]
Scale the whole geometry up or down by a factor $s$.

\item[{\tt-bezier} (boolean)]
If this flag is set, the program outputs bicubic B\'ezier patches
rather than quadrilaterals (the default).  This allows some viewers
(including Geomview) to do a better rendering job.  When you choose
B\'ezier patches you'll probably want to set the options {\tt-du} and
{\tt-dv} to a largish value (say $0.2$, for a $5\times5$ grid), since
you won't need as fine a grid as the default $12\times 12$.
\end{description}

\section*{Symmetries}

When you have one ``fundamental unit'' of the everting sphere, you can
reconstruct the other by applying rotations.  Suppose you ran the
command
%
\smallbreak
{\tt evert -bezier -du 0.25 -dv 0.25 -t 0.5 > evert.out}
\smallbreak\noindent
%
This catches the sphere in the middle of the twisting phase ($t=0.5$),
and produces a mesh of $4\times 4$ B\'ezier patches representing
one-sixteenth of the sphere (from pole to equator, 45$^\circ$ degrees
of longitude).  If you now type
%
\smallbreak
{\tt geomview evert.out}
\smallbreak\noindent
%
you get to see this one-sixteenth.  If you want to see the whole
sphere, there are two possibilities.  One is to rerun {\tt evert} with
{\tt-umax 2} and {\tt-vmax 8}, as explained under those options; this
creates a very large output file.  The other (if you are using
Geomview for viewing) is to create a file that inputs the file {\tt
evert.out} and declares many other {\it instances} of the object read
in, transformed according to $4\times4$ transformation matrices.  The
file {\tt whole.8} that comes with this software serves as an example;
it contains transformation matrices to make up the whole sphere.  So
typing
%
\smallbreak
{\tt geomview whole.8}
\smallbreak\noindent
%
shows the full sphere in the throes of twisting---assuming you have
enough memory on your computer.  Another example symmetry file in this
directory, {\tt double.8}, contains only two transformation matrices:
the identity (which leaves the strip alone) and a rotation that
extends the strip from the northern to the southern hemisphere.  So
when you type
%
\smallbreak
{\tt geomview double.8}
\smallbreak\noindent
%
you get a full strip (one-eight of the sphere).

If you run {\tt evert} with other than eight strips (using the
{\tt-nstrips} option), you should create appropriate symmetry files.
